# Hi there 👋

- 💪 I'm a Front-end developer who is passionate about coding best practices, data visualizations, and trending front-end technologies. I have 3+ years' experiences with Angular before I falled in love with React. I am willing to work on any libraries that makes each product looks more beautiful and convenient for the end-user.  
- 🍄 I also love foods and feeding people around 💙
